# Evolutionary_Bridge_Designer
A set of programs that use evolution to design high-load bearing bridges.

## Descriptions of Scripts:
* `bridgelib.py` contains a preliminary set of functions to calculate simple central point-load bearing abilities of a uniform cross section pi-beam.
* `bridgelib2.py` contains a more advanced set of functions to calculate the load-bearing abilities of a bridge with two cross sections that has two point loads located at 550mm and 1250mm from the left side.
